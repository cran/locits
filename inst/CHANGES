1.1:	a. Changed ALL references from lacv to lacf

	Primary reason: to prevent clashes between this package and costat

	Secondary reason: the autocovariance function in R for stationary
	series is called acf, so the time-varying one should be called
	lacf, should it not? 

	b. if the WPsmooth.type argument of lacf is "RM" then the
	behaviour of the binwidth argument is now different. If
	the argument binwidth is missing or set to zero then an automatic
	bandwidth is selected using the AutoBestBW function.

	c. Added a new argument to plot.lacf.

	The new argument is plot.it. If TRUE then a plot is produced,
	if FALSE then no plot is produced. In both cases the values
	that *would* have been plotted are returned (invisibly). In this
	way the plot.lacf function can be used as an extractor functon.

1.2:	Added plotcor=FALSE option for plot.lacf and plot.lacfCI for the
	type="line" plot. This permits plotting
	of the localized autocovariance function as a line plot

	Improved vertical (y) axis labelling by changing "ACF" to
	"Autocorrelation" and "ACF (cov)" to "Autocovariance"

	Changed lacf so that if lag.max=NULL then the same lag.max
	as in acf is used (this is 10*log(length(x)))

1.3:	changed code internally so that any xlab or ylab values supplied
	to plot.lacf or plot.lacfCI do not get obliterated.

1.4:	added references to paper where underpinning research was carried out
